Create a vector called "statements"
       This will store all of the statements as Triples or Quadruples.

Create a function "gen"
       This will "generate" the 3 address code. Basically it will be syntactic sugar for
       just printing the stuff out. It will also have to store the given statement in 
       "statements".

Create row major ordering
       Convert 2d arrays into 1d arrays

         0   1  2  3 
       0 0   1  2  3
       1 4   5  6  7
       2 8   9 10 11
       3 12 13 14 15
